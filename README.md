# Codename: DataMedic

**AI-powered data reliability agent built for the Nebius × NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon.**

Codename: DataMedic detects data-quality problems, reasons about how they should be handled, automatically repairs high-confidence issues, validates every repair, and sends uncertain cases to a human instead of guessing.

The application uses **NVIDIA Nemotron through Nebius** for agent reasoning and a deterministic Python repair and validation layer for safe execution.

## What Codename: DataMedic Does

Codename: DataMedic takes a CSV dataset and runs an end-to-end data reliability workflow:

1. **Detect** data-quality problems.
2. **Reason** about each issue using NVIDIA Nemotron.
3. **Repair** high-confidence issues automatically.
4. **Verify** every automatic repair by profiling the dataset again.
5. **Rollback** repairs that fail validation.
6. **Request human review** when a correction cannot be made safely.
7. **Audit** automatic and human changes.
8. **Export** the cleaned dataset and audit artifacts.

The original uploaded dataset is never modified.

## Key Features

### Data Profiling

Codename: DataMedic detects issues including:

- Missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Duplicate identifiers
- Category inconsistencies
- Extra whitespace
- Currency formatting inconsistencies
- Mixed date formats
- Ambiguous dates
- Future dates
- Negative numeric values
- Statistical outliers
- Business-rule violations

### Nemotron Reasoning

Detected issues are passed to NVIDIA Nemotron, which proposes an action and confidence score.

DataMedic does not allow the model to directly modify the dataset. Model proposals must pass through the repair and validation layer.

### Safe Automatic Repair

High-confidence repairs can be executed automatically using deterministic repair tools.

Examples include:

- Category standardization
- Currency parsing
- Whitespace trimming
- Date standardization
- Duplicate-row removal

After a repair, Codename: DataMedic profiles the dataset again to verify that the intended issue was actually resolved.

If validation fails, the repair is rolled back.

### Human-in-the-Loop Review

Issues that cannot be corrected safely are sent to the user.

The reviewer can:

- Keep the value as-is
- Decline a proposed action
- Enter a corrected value for a specific row
- Approve supported repair actions

Codename: DataMedic records these decisions in the audit trail.

### Business Rules

Users can optionally upload a JSON rules file.

Supported rules include constraints such as:

- Unique identifiers
- Minimum and maximum numeric values
- Allowed values
- Required values
- Canadian province validation
- Pattern validation

If no rules file is supplied, Codename: DataMedic can infer conservative rules from the dataset.

### Dataset Context

Users can optionally provide a natural-language description of the dataset to give Nemotron additional business context when reasoning about detected issues.

### Data Health Score

Codename: DataMedic calculates a data-health score across quality dimensions including:

- Completeness
- Uniqueness
- Validity
- Consistency
- Business-rule compliance

The interface shows data quality before and after verified repairs.

### Full Auditability

Codename: DataMedic records:

- Detected issue
- Proposed repair
- Confidence
- Repair tool
- Approval source
- Old value
- New value
- Affected row
- Validation result
- Rollbacks
- Human decisions

Outputs include:

- Cleaned CSV
- Audit log JSON
- Audit report PDF

## Safety Model

Codename: DataMedic follows a simple principle:

> **Automate when the evidence is strong. Ask when it isn't.**

The LLM acts as the reasoning layer, while deterministic Python tools perform actual data modifications.

Automatic repairs are re-checked after execution. Failed repairs are rolled back rather than silently accepted.

For ambiguous or unsupported corrections, Codename: DataMedic requests human review instead of inventing data.

## Tested Workflows

### 100% Detection in Synthetic Evaluation

Codename: DataMedic detected **100% of the intentionally planted data-quality errors in our synthetic evaluation dataset across the tested error categories**.

Each detected issue is tracked through Codename: DataMedic's workflow—from profiling and Nemotron reasoning through repair, validation, human review, and the final audit trail.

> **100% refers to the controlled synthetic evaluation and is not a guarantee of detecting every possible error in arbitrary real-world datasets.**

Codename: DataMedic has been tested with both synthetic and external datasets.

Testing covered:

- Automatic issue detection
- Automatic repairs
- Post-repair validation
- Failed-repair rollback
- Human review
- Manual row corrections
- Keep-as-is decisions
- Duplicate resolution
- Automatic rule inference
- Explicit JSON business rules
- Natural-language dataset context
- Empty and invalid CSV handling
- Cleaned CSV generation
- JSON audit generation
- PDF audit report generation
- Fresh-session and new-analysis workflows

## Hackathon

Built for the **Nebius × NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon**.

DataMedic demonstrates an auditable, human-in-the-loop approach to AI-assisted data engineering: allowing an AI agent to reason about messy data while keeping actual modifications deterministic, validated, reversible, and reviewable.
